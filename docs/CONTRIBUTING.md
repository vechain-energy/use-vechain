### Storybook

Pleae make sure that every change is demonstrated in storybook.

During development you can run the bundler in one terminal with `yarn start` and storybook in another with `cd example; yarn install; yarn storybook`

The build output is also used on the website for demonstration purpose. The build snippet is:

```shell
yarn install
yarn link
cd example
yarn install
yarn run build-storybook
```
